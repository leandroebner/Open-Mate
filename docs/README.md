# Hey 👋

Welcome to the official "HOMatE.club" documentation: A local implementation of [Open-Mate](https://github.com/leandroebner/Open-Mate/), an open source mate-lemonade recipe, providing a DIY alternative to commercially available mate-drinks.

## About

HOMatE.club is an attempt and project to create, test, share and iterate an open source recipe for mate-flavoured beverages like the well-known mate-lemonade. The drink is available to the public at our local makerspace "[House Of Makers and Engineers](https://home.rwu.de)". 

## Status

Check the current stock of HOMatE.club at our makerspace [here](status). This page displays helpful information on whether you can stop by to enjoy a drink and helps you estimate when the next batch of drinks will be finished. All changes are tracked in a local Git repository and are visible in the appended history.

## Roadmap

While the growing quantities of caffeine help me to stay productive, this project is still an early stage of work in progress and subject to major changes and updates.
